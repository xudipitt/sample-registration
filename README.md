This sample code implements image registration according to the below paper with OpenCV:

An FFT-Based Technique for Translation Rotation, and Scale-Invariant Image Registration

B. Srinivasa Reddy and B. N. Chatterji

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING, VOL. 5 , NO. 8, AUGUST 1996

Attentively, I avoid scale problem in this paper.
